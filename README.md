# Sane Tachyons

This is a fork of Tachyons. It is sane.

Therefore, it is called `sane-tachyons`.

```bash
yarn add sane-tachyons # or `npm install sane-tachyons`
```

Tachyons gives us:

- Abbreviated, composable, simple, predictable class names
- Massively reduced duplicate CSS
- Mobile first approach
- Reduced specificity issues
- A sensible power of 2 spacing scale `(..., 1rem, 2rem, 4rem, ...)`
- Everything in `rem`

Key changes are:

- written in SCSS, with plenty of variables
  - including maps and lists ðŸŒˆ
- uses a custom reset rather than normalize
  - to encourage use of semantic (crawler/browser/human friendly) html elements
  - for example, `<h1>Text</h1>` looks the same as `<p>Text</p>` until classes
    such as `.h1` or `.normal` are added, but search engine can tell the first
    is a title, potentially improving SEO
- Just one breakpoint, `-l` for large (large is a variable and so can be
  changed, and by default is >480px to target non-phones)
- Adds a few utility classes that aren't included in tachyons
- Fixes some god-awful parts of tachyons, like its approach to flexbox
- Removes some strangely specific tachyons things, like colors and type scale,
  and replaces it with a more real-world setup
- Assumes only supporting sane browsers (with exception of IE11)

Future probable changes are:

- Toggle-able variable font support
- A dev friendly way to tailor the variables to each project
- A dev friendly way to add their custom base to each project
